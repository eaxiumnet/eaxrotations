It Is Advised to Have a Dedicated Group For This
|tip The best rep farm by far is doing Stratholme and Scholomance.
|tip If you don't, the reputation grind is basically just killing mobs for Scourgestones.

|tip 400 Invader's Scorgestones is by default 1,000 reputation.
|tip 40 Corrupted Scourgestones is by default 1,000 reputation.
|tip Without a group, you will be grinding enemies in the Plaguelands zones for Minion and Invader stones.
|tip Corrupted stones only come from bosses in dungeons.
|tip It is also advised to save any quests from the Argent Dawn that you haven't completed until Revered.
|tip You gain reputation from killing enemies in Stratholme and Scholomance until Honored, so it is recommended to save your Scourgestones until Honored.
