Getting Started

### Overview​

In this document, you will learn how to setup your environment and begin developing scripts for Sylvanas. We will try to cover as much information as possible in this short guide, but if you still have any questions you can contact us and we will gladly help you as soon as possible. If you don't have your loader/user setup yet, check Getting Started - User Guide before continuing with this guide.

### Welcome Letter

First of all, thanks for your interest in developing scripts for Sylvanas. Since we are internal, we have our
own custom-made Lua API that is nothing like the WoW one, which can make it seem like working with us is more difficult than what you might be used to; this is why we will always appreciate your hard work and dedication, as we are aware that not everybody would be able to tackle such challenges. As a fellow developer, you will earn our respect; active developers will enjoy a series of  unique benefits. We still don't know the specifics, but one thing is for sure: you will have a
free subscription as long as you are active. As for the other benefits that we are planning, we can't discuss them all with you yet, but more information will be shared as soon as possible. Among these benefits, we are thinking of monetization support for some Lua Scripts.

For full details about our developer roles, benefits, and monetization system, please visit the
👉 Developer Program Overview page.

Without further ado, let's begin programming!

### Getting Started​

note
You can skip this part if you already have Visual Studio Code installed and the sumneko Lua extension installed and enabled.

First of all, we have to setup our IDE. You can program even with a notepad if you want, but we recommend you to follow this small tutorial, since we provide with intellisense mechanisms that are only available on Visual Studio Code with the sumneko Lua extension. (You can ignore the first 2 steps if you already have Visual Studio Code installed)

Navigate to Visual Studio Code - Official Page

Click on the "Download for Windows" button and install the program.

Open Visual Studio Code

Navigate to the extensions section (on the left bar, the second icon starting from the botton). Then, search "LUA" and install the first plugin that appears. (Check that the developer is "sumneko", just in case).

Now, our IDE is good to go. The next step is to prepare our scripting development environment.

Go to the folder where you have placed your loader

Locate the "Scripts" folder and place yourself inside of it.

There, you will see many encripted scripts that were donwloaded after you logged into your account using the loader.

The files that are required for you to develop your scripts are "Common" and the ones starting with "Core". Developer tools and prediction playground are nice to have too. (Although we recommend to not modify the initial Scripts folder)

Create a folder inside the scripts folder. For example, "script_plugin_test"

Inside "script_plugin_test", we will create 2 files: header.lua and main.lua

Now, everything is almost ready to actually begin coding.

note
You can also just download the example plugin below. (Although downloading it from the Github repo is recommended, so you can be sure that you are downloading the latest version.)

### Checking the API File (Optional)​

The Lua plugin that we previously added to Visual Studio Code no longer requires you to manually download the API files. The _api folder is now automatically updated and managed by us whenever you run the loader. This ensures that you always have the latest version of the API in your script folder without any extra effort.

However, if you’re curious to explore or manually check the API files, you can still access them here:

note
You can browse the latest _api folder on our open GitHub repository.

tip
Alternatively, you can download the mage fire example, which
already includes a sample setup.

After your setup is successful, you should see Intellisense working:

Now, we should be good to actually start programming :)

### Header File​

warning
The name of this file MUST be "header.lua". Other names are not accepted and the core won't recognize your script if you attempt to modify its file name.

This is the file that will essentially tell the core if your script will be loaded or not. This makes sense because you might develop a Fire Mage script, for example.
The script shouldn't be loaded under any circumstance if the user is not playing a Fire Mage in this case. This file is also used to uniquely identify your plugin.

You will see how to use it more clearly with an example (the following example is the same code that we use in the Placeholder Plugin):

```
local plugin = {}plugin["name"] = "Placeholder Script"plugin["version"] = "0.0.0"plugin["author"] = "Placeholder Author"plugin["load"] = true-- check if local player exists before loading the script (user is on loading screen / not ingame)local local_player = core.object_manager.get_local_player()if not local_player then    plugin["load"] = false    return pluginend---@type enumslocal enums = require("common/enums")local player_class = local_player:get_class()-- change this line with the class of your scriptlocal is_valid_class = player_class == enums.class_id.DRUIDif not is_valid_class then    plugin["load"] = false    return pluginendlocal player_spec_id = core.spell_book.get_specialization_id()-- change this line with the spec id of your script-- the spec id is in the same order as it appears in the talents WoW UIlocal is_valid_spec_id = player_spec_id == 1if not is_valid_spec_id then    plugin["load"] = false    return pluginendreturn plugin
```

As you can see, the core is expecting a table to be returned, with the following members filled:

"name"

"version"

"author"

"load"

All the elements of the table are self-explanatory. Just note that when the table["load"] is false, the plugin won't be loaded.

### Main File​

warning
The name of this file MUST be "main.lua". Other names are not accepted and the core won't recognize your script if you attempt to modify its file name.

This is the file where all your logics must be placed, as this is the only file that the core will read, other than the header one. You can obviously have multiple files, just note that you will eventually have to
import the code that you want to be run to the main file.


Since main.lua can become quite lengthy, we’ll start with a brief example here. For more detailed scripts, see the examples below.

```
-- Note:-- This is a very basic example.-- For a more comprehensive example, visit our GitHub or download the Fire Mage example script provided below.local menu_elements ={    main_tree = core.menu.tree_node(),    keybinds_tree_node = core.menu.tree_node(),    -- you can add more menu elements in future here}-- and now render them:local function my_menu_render()    menu_elements.main_tree:render("Simple Example", function()        -- this is the checkbohx that will appear upon opening the previous tree node        menu_elements.enable_script_check:render("Enable Script")        -- you can render more menu elements in future here...    end)endcore.log("Hello World! (This should be printed just once on console)")local function my_on_update()    local is_plugin_enabled = menu_elements.enable_script_check:get_state()    if is_plugin_enabled then        -- When menu element enable_script_check        -- Is true, this will spam console in white        core.log("Plugin Test is ENABLED!")    else        -- When menu element enable_script_check        -- Is false, this will spam console in yellow        core.log_warning("[DISABLED] Test Plugin")    endendcore.register_on_update_callback(my_on_update)core.register_on_render_menu_callback(my_menu_render)
```

### The way Sylvanas uses the main/header files​

The way we handle the Lua is simple. We just read the header file and the main file once (on injection / Lua reload). Then, we store all the information that is present in both files and then we internally run the code that we just stored. All the code that are not callbacks, or inside a callback, is just read and executed once.

note
For more information about callbacks, check the more in-depth explanation of the available callbacks. You should know the way they work and what each one of them does before begining to develop scripts.

#### Legacy vs. IZI SDK​

Over the past year, we’ve learned a lot from our community of developers, the struggles, the questions, and the creative solutions you’ve come up with.
To celebrate our first anniversary, we’re introducing something special: IZI SDK.

#### 🧩 What is IZI SDK?​

IZI SDK is a brand-new developer wrapper built on top of our Legacy API.
It doesn’t introduce new features or performance improvements, instead, it focuses entirely on making development simpler, faster, and more intuitive.

Think of it as the same powerful engine, but with a friendlier dashboard.
It lets you focus more on creativity and design, rather than technical hurdles or low-level setup.

Key ideas behind IZI SDK:

Built on top of the Legacy API (fully retrocompatible)

Designed for ease of use, not maximum performance

Great for beginners or anyone who prefers a smoother “vibe coding” experience

Perfect stepping stone before diving into Legacy API for full control and customization

While there’s a small trade-off in flexibility and performance, we believe it’s a worthwhile price for the simplicity it offers, especially when starting out.

#### 🧙 Choose Your Path​

Starting from this point, you can choose your preferred learning path:

##### 🔹 Option 1: Continue with Legacy API​

If you want to learn how everything works under the hood and get full control over performance, customization, and flow, keep following the Legacy API documentation.

Example: Fire Mage (Legacy)

Next Page: Developer Program → Overview

##### 🔹 Option 2: Try the New IZI SDK (Recommended)​

If you’re new to the ecosystem or prefer to start coding right away with less setup and cleaner syntax, check out the new IZI SDK.

Example: Fire Mage (IZI)

Visit: IZI SDK Documentation

#### ✨ In Short​

Both SDKs are great, it’s all about where you want to start.
We recommend beginning with IZI SDK for its simplicity and comfort, then progressively moving toward the Legacy API as you gain experience and want more control.

💡 Tip: IZI SDK is completely compatible with the Legacy API. Everything you learn here will still apply if you decide to switch later.

### Examples​

We have many examples available on the Examples page to demonstrate how to use both the IZI SDK and the Legacy API. These examples include full source code and code breakdowns you can reference in order to learn more about the ecosystem.
