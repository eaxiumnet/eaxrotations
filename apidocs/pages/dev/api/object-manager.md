## Overview

👨‍💻 Lua Scripting API
Object Manager

### Introduction 📃​

The Lua Object Manager module is your gateway to interacting with game objects in your scripts. While the core engine provides fundamental functions, we've developed additional tools to enhance your scripting capabilities and optimize performance. Let's explore how to leverage these features effectively!

#### core.object_manager.get_local_player() -> game_object​

Retrieves the local player game_object.

Returns: game_object - The local player game_object.

tip
Always verify the local player object before use. Implement a guard clause in your callbacks to prevent errors and ensure safe execution. Remember, the local_player is a pointer (8 bytes) to the game memory object, which can become invalid. Check its existence before each use.
Example of a guard clause:

```
local function on_update()    local local_player = core.object_manager.get_local_player()    if not local_player then        return -- Exit early if local_player is invalid    end    -- Your logic here, safely using local_playerend
```

This approach maintains code stability and prevents accessing invalid memory addresses.

#### core.object_manager.get_all_objects() -> table​

Retrieves all game objects.

Returns: table - A table containing all game_objects.

warning
Use get_all_objects() and get_visible_objects() judiciously. These functions return a comprehensive list, including non-unit entities, which can be computationally expensive to process every frame.
For most scenarios, our custom unit_helper library (discussed later) is recommended for optimized performance and more relevant object lists.

tip
New to scripting? Visualize objects with this example:

```
---@type colorlocal color = require("common/color")core.register_on_render_callback(function()    local all_objects = core.object_manager.get_all_objects()    for _, object in ipairs(all_objects) do        local current_object_position = object:get_position()        core.graphics.circle_3d(current_object_position, 2.0, color.cyan(100), 30.0, 1.5)    endend)
```

Code breakdown:

Import the color module for color creation.

Register a function for frame rendering.

Retrieve all game objects.

Iterate through each object.

Get each object's position (returns a vec3).

Draw a 3D circle at each position:

Center: Object's position

Radius: 2.0 yards

Color: Cyan (alpha 100)

Thickness: 30.0 units

Fade factor: 1.5 (higher value = faster fade)

This visualization helps you grasp the scope of objects returned by get_all_objects().

tip
Want to dive deeper? Try accessing more object properties:

```
---@type enumslocal enums = require("common/enums")core.register_on_render_callback(function()    local all_objects = core.object_manager.get_all_objects()    for _, object in ipairs(all_objects) do        local name = object:get_name()        local health = object:get_health()        local max_health = object:get_max_health()        local position = object:get_position()        local class_id = object:get_class()        -- Convert class_id to a readable string        local class_name = "Unknown"        if class_id == enums.class_id.WARRIOR then            class_name = "Warrior"        elseif class_id == enums.class_id.WARLOCK then            class_name = "Warlock"        -- Add more class checks as needed        end        -- Log the information        core.log(string.format("Name: %s, Class: %s, Health: %d/%d, Position: (%.2f, %.2f, %.2f)",                            name, class_name, health, max_health, position.x, position.y, position.z))    endend)
```

This example showcases how to access various game object properties and use the enums module for interpreting class IDs. Feel free to expand on this for more complex visualizations or analysis tools!

#### Visible Objects​

warning
---- Not currently implemented ----

#### core.object_manager.get_visible_objects() -> table​

Retrieves all visible game objects.

Returns: table - A table containing all visible game_objects.

### Unit Helper - Optimized Object Retrieval 🚀​

To address performance concerns and provide targeted functionality, we've developed the unit_helper library. This toolkit offers optimized methods for retrieving specific types of game objects, utilizing caching and filtering for improved performance.

note
To use the unit_helper module, include it in your script:

```
---@type unit_helperlocal unit_helper = require("common/utility/unit_helper")
```

#### unit_helper:get_enemy_list_around(point: vec3, range: number, include_out_of_combat: boolean, include_blacklist: boolean) -> table​

Retrieves a list of enemy units around a specified point.

Returns: table - A table containing enemy game_objects.

Parameters:

point: vec3 - The center point to search around.

range: number - The radius (in yards) to search within.

include_out_of_combat: boolean - If true, includes units not in combat.

include_blacklist: boolean - If true, includes special units (use with caution).

Example usage:

```
---@type colorlocal color = require("common/color")---@type unit_helperlocal unit_helper = require("common/utility/unit_helper")core.register_on_render_callback(function()    local local_player = core.object_manager.get_local_player()    if not local_player then        return    end    local local_player_position = local_player:get_position()    local range_to_check = 40.0 -- yards    local enemies_around = unit_helper:get_enemy_list_around(local_player_position, range_to_check, false, false)    for _, enemy in ipairs(enemies_around) do        local enemy_position = enemy:get_position()        core.graphics.circle_3d(enemy_position, 2.0, color.red(255), 30.0, 1.2)    endend)
```

This code visualizes enemies around the player with red circles, demonstrating the focused nature of unit_helper functions.

#### unit_helper:get_ally_list_around(point: vec3, range: number, players_only: boolean, party_only: boolean) -> table​

Retrieves a list of allied units around a specified point.

Returns: table - A table containing allied game_objects.

Parameters:

point: vec3 - The center point to search around.

range: number - The radius (in yards) to search within.

players_only: boolean - If true, only includes player characters.

party_only: boolean - If true, only includes party members.

Example usage:

```
---@type colorlocal color = require("common/color")---@type unit_helperlocal unit_helper = require("common/utility/unit_helper")local function my_on_render()    local local_player = core.object_manager.get_local_player()    if not local_player then        return    end    local range_to_check = 40.0 -- yards    local green_color = color.new(0, 255, 0, 230)    local player_position = local_player:get_position()    local allies_around = unit_helper:get_ally_list_around(player_position, range_to_check, false, false)    for _, ally in ipairs(allies_around) do        local ally_position = ally:get_position()        core.graphics.circle_3d(ally_position, 2.0, green_color, 30.0, 1.5)    endendcore.register_on_render_callback(my_on_render)
```

Let's break down the optimizations in this code:

Module Imports: We import necessary modules for color and unit helper functions.

Named Function: We use a named function my_on_render() for better readability and debugging.

Early Exit: We implement a guard clause for the local player check.

Pre-loop Calculations: We define constants and calculate values outside the loop for efficiency.

Optimized Retrieval: We use unit_helper:get_ally_list_around() for targeted, efficient object retrieval.

Efficient Looping: We use ipairs() for optimal iteration.

### Performance Considerations 🏎️​

This code showcases several key performance optimizations:

Color Calculation: Pre-calculating the color object reduces redundant calculations.

Player Position: Calculating player_position once avoids repeated calls.

Targeted Retrieval: Using unit_helper functions significantly reduces processed objects.

Efficient Looping: Proper use of ipairs() ensures optimal iteration.

### Optimization Principles 📊​

Key principles demonstrated:

Minimize Repetitive Calculations: Perform constant calculations outside loops.

Use Specialized Functions: Employ targeted functions for efficient processing.

Early Exit: Use guard clauses to avoid unnecessary computations.

Readability and Maintainability: Balance optimizations with code clarity.

tip
The unit_helper functions not only boost performance but also provide more relevant data for most scripting scenarios. By using these functions, you can create more efficient and focused scripts, reducing unnecessary iterations and checks.

Remember, effective scripting often involves balancing raw data access with optimized helper functions. As you develop more complex scripts, consider the performance implications of your choices and leverage the unit_helper library when appropriate. Happy scripting! 🚀
